# Backend REST APIs using Spring Boot Application

This project aims to design a backend RESTful API system using Spring Boot, focusing on CRUD operations for managing employee data.

## Features

- **Employee CRUD Operations**: Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing employee data.
- **Validation**: Implement validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity and consistency.
- **Exception Handling**: Add exception handling to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
- **Swagger Documentation**: Integrate Swagger for API documentation to facilitate understanding and usage of the APIs.
- **Spring Security**: Implement Spring Security to secure the APIs and enforce role-based access control.
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define roles and permissions for accessing the APIs:
  - Users with the role [USER] have view access only.
  - Users with the role [DEV] can perform create and update operations.
  - Users with the role [ADMIN] can perform delete operations.

## Technologies Used

- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Swagger
- Spring Security

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Spring Boot application.
3. Access the Swagger UI for API documentation and testing.
4. Use appropriate role-based credentials to access different endpoints.

# Frontend for Existing REST APIs using React

In this project, we will design a frontend interface using React to interact with the existing backend REST APIs developed using Spring Boot.

## Features

- **User Interface**: Design a user-friendly interface for interacting with the backend APIs.
- **Form Validation**: Implement form validation to ensure data integrity and provide a seamless user experience.
- **Integration with Backend**: Connect the frontend application with the backend APIs to perform CRUD operations.
- **Role-based Access Control**: Implement UI elements visibility based on user roles to enforce role-based access control as defined in the backend.

## Technologies Used

- React
- React Router
- Formik (for form handling)
- Yup (for schema validation)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository containing the frontend code.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the frontend application using `npm start`.
4. Access the application in your browser and interact with the UI to perform CRUD operations.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the backend Spring Boot application is running and accessible before using the frontend application.
- Use appropriate credentials and roles for testing different functionalities.
- For detailed API documentation, refer to the Swagger UI provided by the backend application.
